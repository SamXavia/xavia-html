# Welcome
Welcome to the Xavia HTML website, this is my website that I'm developing using HTML, CSS and JS. I had a small bit of experince developing sites in School but not much, meaning i've had to self-teach most of what I know. There's probably better ways for me to code my website, any suggestions are welcomed.

# Projects
I use my website for projects that i'm currently and previously worked on. These Projects can then be shared with the world through my website allowing me to communicate to everyone.

# Welcome
Welcome to the Xavia HTML website, this is my website that I'm developing using HTML, CSS and JS. I had a small bit of experince developing sites in School but not much, meaning i've had to self-teach most of what I know. There's probably better ways for me to code my website, any suggestions are welcomed.
